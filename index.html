<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p> The baseball graph is a knowledge graph that is meant to supply information for reporters on important people
and businesses. A baseball card is the visualization of one person that the reporter is after and it will be connected
to other people so the reporter can draw a lot of information on the person they are after. Think of Wikipedia, but for
 important people and businesses. This is a project that was given to me and 3 other students for our Big Data class.
 Our mentor wanted us to not spend to much time on the visualization of information, 
but because I'm taking this class I can devote time to make a really cool product.</p>

This website is still a work in progress. I hope to continue working on it through the rest of the semester as my creative projects. It will eventually have a database of our knowledge graph connected so you can access our full knowledge graph. At the moment our database isn't built and I haven't learned Jquery or Javascript which I believe I will need to make that happen. So at the moment this is just a skeleton to what we hope to make.
